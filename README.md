# Dear Ms. Cloud

I believe this page will help better explain the six degrees of separation that we've been trying to work on. I will call you as soon as I can of course. These are a few important points before we begin.
- An element is a person, company or event. In our example, we've simply named them element 1, element 2, and so on.. 
- A node represents an important date for an element. Thereby, every node is defined by an element and a date (we're only looking at the year to simplify things for now)
- The intention of this project is to understand and present the extent of relationship between every single element that exists in the automotive world through time.

We're going to look at this in five major steps and in each case, we're isolating one major part of the entire thing which will be presented at the end. 

### PS - all the charts below are interactive and a label will appear when you move your mouse over them with relevant text to avoid confusion.


## We begin by plotting all the nodes of a single element and a line through them so that it's easier to keep track.

## The stories (which depict a relation between any two or more elements) exist between two nodes. The green lines are these stories.

## We now add in the spheres - each sphere represents a year.

## If we increase the number of elements and plot nodes and respective lines (including those for the story) through all of them, this is the final plot we get.
